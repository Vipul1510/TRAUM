**Case Study:**</br>
Sustainability means meeting our own needs without compromising the ability of
future generations to meet their own needs. With non-renewable sources
exhausting, the need to move towards a sustainable ecosystem is more now than ever
before. Food for thought - How can one harness this and convert it into a profitable
entrepreneurial model?</br>
Electric vehicles are emerging in the automobile industry. Energy is not consumed while
the electric vehicle is stationary, unlike internal combustion engines which consume fuel
while idling thereby making it energy efficient. The vision is to have 100% electric
vehicles by 2030 in the Indian vehicle market.</br>
Recent initiatives and various subsidies by the Indian government also focus on
promoting more viable and long-term energy solutions. Thereâ€™s a huge market
opportunity around sustainable sources over nonrenewable resources but few
roadblocks still exist before renewable sources can full-fledge take over the mainstream
market.</br>
Presently, EV market penetration is only 1% of total vehicle sales in India, and of that,
95% of sales are electric two-wheelers. Currently, India has only 150 charging stations.
Owing to these factors, anxiety amongst consumers regarding electric vehicles
continues. The inadequate charging infrastructure and lack of quality maintenance and
repair options deter buyers from investing in electric vehicles.</br>
The opportunity is huge so build upon an idea to harness the current situation and make
it profitable for both company and the nation. Think about how you can bring about a
change in the mindset of consumers to adopt this new technology with your innovative
start-up.</br>
**Your team has a bunch of start-up enthusiasts to ideate, interpret, and execute with an
Entrepreneurial mindset approach and come up with a start-up. (There would be multiple
problems in the market, Identify one key issue that you would like to solve with your
business plan).**</span><hr>
